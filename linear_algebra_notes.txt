Vectors:
	Vectors are objects that 
	- can be added together to form a new vector, 
	- can be multiplied by a scalar (a number) to form a new vector

Vectors are good way to represent numeric data.

Vectors can be represented in the list form.

Vector Addition-

	[1,2] + [2,1] = [1+2,2+1] = [3,3]


Matrix:
	A matrix is a 2-D collection of numbers. It can be represented as list of lists.

	A = [[1,2,3],
	     [4,5,6]]
	This is a 2-row,3-column matrix.
